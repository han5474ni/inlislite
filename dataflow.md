# Dataflow Diagram for InlisLite System

## Key Components

1. **Users**:
   - Admins and general users access the system.
   - Admins manage users, features, modules, and other components.

2. **Controllers**:
   - **AdminController**: Handles dashboard, login/logout, and user management.
   - **PublicController**: Handles public views like home, about, features, installer, patches, and others.

3. **Models**:
   - **UserModel**: Manages all user-related operations, including authentication and profile updates.
   - **FeatureModel & FiturModel**: Manage the features and modules available in the system.
   - **Various other models**: For managing cards, patches, installers, etc.

4. **Database**:
   - Tables include `users`, `fitur`, `features`, `tentang_cards`, `installer_cards`, `patches`, etc.
   - Handles CRUD operations, relations, and data storage.

5. **Views**:
   - **Admin Views**: For managing dashboards, features, users, etc.
   - **Public Views**: For displaying public information like home pages, about, and others.

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication & Session Management**:
   - Users log in through the `AdminController`.
   - Sessions store user roles and last login details.

2. **Dashboard Interaction**:
   - Admins access real-time data on the dashboard.
   - Data includes user stats, registration trends, and system activity logs.

3. **Feature & Module Management**:
   - Features and modules are created, updated, and deleted through the `FiturModel` and `FeatureModel`.
   - Features can be sorted and have status changes tracked.

4. **Public Interaction**:
   - Users browse public pages served by the `PublicController`.
   - Information is dynamically loaded from models such as `TentangCardModel` and displayed in views.

5. **Installation & Setup**:
   - Installers and patches are managed via admin interfaces.
   - Additional functions for handling downloads and application support are available.

## Diagram

This structure can be translated into a visual dataflow diagram with:
- **Entities**: Users (admin, public) interacting with the system.
- **Processes**: Authentication, dashboard, feature management.
- **Data Stores**: Users, features, modules, installer packages, patches.
- **Flows**: Arrows indicating data requests/responses between components.
